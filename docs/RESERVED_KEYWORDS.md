# Quill Reserved Keywords

This document lists all reserved keywords in Quill v1.0.0. You **cannot** use these words as variable names, function names, or identifiers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Matters

If you try to use a reserved keyword as a variable name, you'll get a syntax error like:
```
‚úó Syntax Error: Expected TokenType.IDENTIFIER, got TokenType.CHOICE at line 10
```

## ‚úÖ Good Variable Names (Safe to Use)

These common words are **NOT** reserved and safe to use:

```Quill
# ‚úÖ These all work fine:
set name = "Alice"
set age = 25
set score = 100
set health = 50
set items = []
set count = 0
set total = 0
set message = "Hello"
set player = "Bob"
set enemy = "Dragon"
set damage = 10
set level = 5
set experience = 1000
set gold = 500
set position = "north"
set status = "alive"
set answer = "yes"
set result = 42
set value = 3.14
set data = [1, 2, 3]
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### Using 'choice' as a variable
```Quill
# ‚ùå WRONG - 'choice' is a reserved keyword
ask "Enter your choice:" into choice

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use a different name
ask "Enter your choice:" into user_choice
ask "Enter your choice:" into selection
ask "Enter your choice:" into option_num
```

### Using 'question' as a variable
```Quill
# ‚ùå WRONG - 'question' was a keyword (now removed in v1.0.0)
# But avoid similar confusion

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
ask "Do you want to continue?" into answer
ask "Do you want to continue?" into response
ask "Do you want to continue?" into user_input
```

### Using loop keywords
```Quill
# ‚ùå WRONG - 'repeat' is a synonym for 'while'
set repeat = 5

# ‚úÖ CORRECT
set repeat_count = 5
set num_repeats = 5
set iterations = 5
```

## üí° Tips for Avoiding Conflicts

1. **Be specific** - Instead of `choice`, use `user_choice`, `menu_choice`, or `selection`
2. **Add prefixes/suffixes** - `my_variable`, `variable_name`, `current_status`
3. **Use underscores** - `user_input` instead of trying `input` alone
4. **Check the list** - When in doubt, check this document!

## üîç How to Check if a Word is Reserved

Run this test program:

```Quill
# Test if a word is reserved
set YOUR_WORD_HERE = 1
say "Success! This word is safe to use."
```

If you get a syntax error, the word is reserved!

## üìù Version History

### v1.0.0 (October 15, 2025)
- Removed GUI keywords (`window`, `button`, `color`, `style`, `size`, etc.)
- Removed `question` as alias for `ask`
- Removed `choose`, `select`, `option` as aliases for `choice`
- Core language keywords only

### Future Versions
GUI keywords may be re-introduced as optional extensions in v1.1.0+

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter a keyword conflict:

1. **Read the error message** - It tells you which keyword caused the problem
2. **Rename your variable** - Choose a more descriptive name
3. **Check this list** - Make sure your new name isn't reserved
4. **See ERROR_MESSAGES.md** - For more debugging help

---

**Remember:** Descriptive variable names make your code easier to read anyway! `user_choice` is clearer than `choice`, and `player_health` is clearer than `health`. üí™
