## 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND (Must Fix for 1.0.1)

### Bug #1: EOF Error Handling
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Programs crash with "EOF when reading a line" when input is piped or runs out  
**Files Affected:**
- `examples/example_calculator.quill`
- `examples/demo_inventory.quill`
- Any program with user input in loops

**Fix Needed:**
- Add try/except around input() calls in interpreter.py
- Gracefully exit when EOF is reached
- Add helpful message: "Input ended unexpectedly"

**Location:** `core/interpreter.py` - look for `input()` calls
